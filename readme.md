# citb-game - A Rust Implementation of Cat in the Box

This is an in-project experimental adaptation of the trick-taking card game Cat in the Box, which I am implementing as a way to learn and explore the Rust language. It also is a way to let me practice Clean Architecture and other design principles.

In the `design` directory, I have included documentation for the design that I am using and developing for this piece of software. This includes PlantUML diagrams; see the [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com) webpage for more information (including methods of rendering the diagrams yourself).

For the rules of the game, see [RulesPal] (https://www.rulespal.com/cat-in-the-box/rulebook)
